# Trapping Rain Water â€“ Java Implementation

## Overview

This Java program calculates the total amount of **trapped rainwater** between bars in a histogram. It uses an efficient approach by precomputing the **left max** and **right max** boundaries for each bar to determine how much water can be trapped at each position.

This is based on the **"Trapping Rain Water"** problem commonly found in coding interviews and competitive programming platforms.

## How It Works

Given an array of non-negative integers where each element represents the height of a bar, the algorithm:

1. Computes an array `leftMax[]` where each element holds the maximum height to the **left** (including itself).
2. Computes an array `rightMax[]` where each element holds the maximum height to the **right** (including itself).
3. For each bar, calculates the **water level** as `min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i])`.
4. Computes **trapped water** at that index as `waterLevel - height[i]`.
5. Sums up trapped water for all bars.
